The **purpose of this project** is to have some **well-written** and **well-documented code** in a GitHub repository that illustrates you can write some Python code. This project is for **your** Portfolio, so pick something you are **interested in** or that's **useful** (either in some professional work or automating some task). [Learn how the project is evaluated (rubric)](https://github.com/pratt-savi-810/pratt-savi-810-2020-03-project).


#### Project Routes

There's a couple of routes you can go;

1. **Creating a Tool to Automate a Task** - usually for some task automation, less an analysis, more data engineering. 
2. **Performing Data Analysis to Answer a Research Question** - this type of project requires plots and data insights. 

Since writing the code is the challenging part. Do not think about this in scope of a normal project. **Keep your scope focused!** Keep it limited in functionality and if you finish early, you can add more features. I've seen students go down some pretty deep rabbit holes and emerge with some very disorganized projects. You could have only 30 lines of code or so, and still have a great project so long as the code is well written and the doc's are informative and it has some functionality that's useful in some capacity. Most likely someone such as a hiring manager will only glance at your Repository, so you want it to be organized and clean and very clear as to its purpose. 



## Assignment 04 Submission
You will **Fork** and **Clone this Repo** and **edit this README.md Markdown file**. This is your submission, just the link to your forked Repo and edited README.md file. This project should be the edited version of this README.md (**Markdown**) file.

## Executive Summary

A _brief description_ of your final project idea. 

- **Why** are you doing this project? 
	- Amid the Novel Coronavirus pandemic, I would like to provide a clear presentation of the different COVID-19 outbreak responses, specifically South Korea and the U.S., and their outcomes
    
- **How** do you imagine you'll accomplish this project? 
	- Collect COVID-19 data from both US government and South Korea government
	- Organize and modify collected data
	- Create interactive maps, charts, timelines
	- Compare and contrast
	- Analyze 

- Is this a project **Creating a Tool to Automate a Task** or **Performing Data Analysis to Answer a Research Questio**? 
	- This project will focus more on data analysis rather than task automation.

This should be a paragraph or so and provide a _high-level overview_ of your project. Again this is a summary, so think of this as the "Elevator Pitch". 


## Background

A more **detailed background** of your project, please include any information that would be useful for understanding the context of the project. This can be as long or short as you'd like. 

<blockquote>
The initial idea behind this project was to create a tool to automate an interactive map for **contact tracing**. Contact tracing is a concept of tracing and monitoring contacts and travels of each confirmed case (infected person).  Sharing this data anonymously to the public and notifying people of their exposure.  Ultimately this helps to prevent additional transmission.  China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore effectively and successfully utilized technology for contact tracing and slowed the spread of coronavirus.  However, due to privacy concerns, western countries like the U.S., Italy, Spain, and France are experiencing difficulty deploying technology to share data on the confirmed cases.
<br>
South Korea has been looked up to by many country leaders who are fighting against the novel coronavirus.  South Korea and Hong Kong are the top two countries that are successfully beating the pandemic.  I wanted to see how South Korea's approach and response differed to the U.S.'.  This will include not only COVID-19 related data (confirmed cases, fatalities, testing, etc.) but also each country leader's and their administration's response, WHO/CDC/HHS's announcements, and other major changes affected by coronavirus.  I will then analyze the comparison and contrast with appropriate data visualization.
